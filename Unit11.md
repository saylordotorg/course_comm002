**Unit 11: Media Law and Media Ethics** <span id="11"></span> 
*Ethics, someone once said, govern your behavior even when no one is
looking. In today’s world of mass communication, someone is always
looking and all too eager to point out your bad behavior. In a way this
is good. The reporter who makes stuff up, the photographer who fakes a
picture, even the student who rips off someone else’s work, are much
less likely to get away with it, thanks to the millions of eyes that
might be watching and the efficient search engines at our command. Mass
media can do great harm or great good, and today we all have that
massive power at our command. This unit will take a too brief look at
ethical and legal considerations surrounding mass communication.*

    but inside the comedy is a serious demonstration of how our own
    media goes for what sells. Stewart compares the covers of *TIME*’s

     Instructions: Read Stephen Balkaran’s article; he believes the
    media has “stereotyped young African-American males as gangsters or
    drug dealers.” And he doesn’t limit this charge to entertainment;
    the news media, he writes, spend “too little time to describing the
    background problems of African-Americans,” instead “enumerating the
    wounded.”

    Editors report to download the PDF document. Read the overall
    findings and skim the results. Lapchick writes, “It is important to

     Instructions: Before we go further, read this summary of various
    ethical models. Those in the media must strike a balance between
    duty and care for others. For example, a television reporter has a
    duty to report corruption in government, but these reports usually
    affect the people involved. When the story is less important to the
    greater good, the decision to report something that might harm
    someone becomes harder to make. After this subunit, you can apply
    what you’ve learned to the news media in the next subunit.

     Instructions: Bob Steele of the Poynter Institute discusses civic
    journalism, a form of journalism that seeks to put people in the
    community first. It is a style of journalism that many in the news
    business believe strays into the realm of making news, not just

    tease out the news that affects everyday people?

that are grounded in duty, such as telling the truth and avoiding
plagiarism, and those that are based on caring for others.

    governed by “rules” because every situation has its own set of
    variables.

    “[d]iscrimination or the tolerance of discrimination of any kind,
    whether on the basis of race, gender, creed, age, sexuality, family
    status, disability, or national origin.” Think back to Anita
    Sarkeesian’s experience with proposing a study of games from a
    feminist perspective. Does the code of ethics square with what
    you’ve read about the gamer culture and its treatment of women?

    difficult to find, but today a Google search of a person’s name will
    turn up everything, even long forgotten newspaper articles about

**11.5.1 Freedom of Speech** <span id="11.5.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Bill Kovarik’s *Media Law (400)*: “The US Constitution
    and the Bill of Rights”**
    Link: Bill Kovarik’s *Media Law (400)*: [“The US Constitution and
    the Bill of
    Rights”](http://www.environmentalhistory.org/billkovarik/media-law-coms-400/free-speech-in-history/2-5-history/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Professor Kovarik lays out the constitutional
    protection of freedom of speech embodied in the First Amendment. As
    you read subunits below about government regulation of broadcasting,
    keep in mind that most speech is out of the government’s control; it
    is free.  
        
     Reading this section should take approximately 30 minutes.

**11.5.1.2 Libel** <span id="11.5.1.2"></span>

    and [“Libel
    Cases”](http://www.environmentalhistory.org/billkovarik/media-law-coms-400/4-libel/4a-libel-cases/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read these two sections of Professor Kovarik’s
    website, paying close attention to what constitutes libel. Keep in
    mind that libel cases in the courts are civil cases; someone who
    believes he or she has been libeled must sue for damages. News
    organizations in particular want to avoid libel suits because they
    are expensive and because such suits hurt the organization’s
    reputation. But libel carries no criminal penalties. In the review
    of libel cases, pay special attention to the 1964 case *New York
    Times v. Sullivan*. This case established many of the precedents
    that protect the media in its coverage of government and public
    figures.

    “Chapter 15, Section 3: Censorship and Freedom of Speech” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Many of the controversies over censorship arise from
    the special place broadcasting holds in communication law. Because
    radio and television stations use a limited resource -the spectrum
    of electromagnetic broadcast waves -they have been required to
    broadcast in the public interest under the watchful eye of the
    Federal Communications Commission. This section of your textbook on
    pages 686-696 discusses these issues in depth.
