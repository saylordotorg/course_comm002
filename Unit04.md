**Unit 4: The Book as the Original Mass Medium** <span id="4"></span> 
*Johann Gutenberg (ca. 1400–1468) did not invent printing, but his
practical method of producing metal type and using it to print books
changed the world. Gutenberg’s printing press altered how culture was
reproduced and transmitted, from a largely oral tradition to the written
word. You could say that his invention created a whole new culture of
reproduction: books needed libraries, libraries became centers of
learning, universities formed, and the Enlightenment followed. Books
became a form of popular entertainment as the middle class emerged with
disposable income and leisure time. Now the world of books and the
culture of reproduction are changing with the advent of electronic
books. This unit will trace that history, exploring issues such as
intellectual property rights along the way. *

    Bible”](http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: According to the Harry Ransom Center website,
    Gutenberg planned to print 200 copies of his Bible on rag cotton
    linen paper and 30 on vellum, an animal skin. No one knows how many
    copies were actually printed, but only 22 copies are known to
    survive today, seven on vellum. In addition to the one at Harry
    Ransom Center, copies reside on display at the [British
    Library](http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/homepage.html) and at
    the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, among other places. The
    Harry Ransom Center quotes a cost of $100 million for a complete
    Bible, but really such books are beyond price. Read through all
    materials on Gutenberg and take a good look at the quality and
    beauty of this first printed book.

     Instructions: Five centuries before Facebook and the Arab spring,
    social media helped bring about the Reformation, except the medium
    was printing. Your textbook describes how Thomas Paine’s
    “pamphlets,” really short books, became part of the philosophical
    basis for the American Revolution. *Common Sense* in its original
    form was 48 pages. This article, with accompanying audio, describes
    one of the earliest uses of the printing press as a mass medium, or
    even as a social medium.

     Instructions: Go to this website for an interesting list of 50
    great books that had a profound effect on the world and its culture;
    tally how many of the books you have read. We have said that the
    mass media are cultural industries, and that is something that has
    been true since the advent of printing more than 550 years ago. Have
    any of these books shaped your view of the world, or in other words,
    shaped your culture? Remember, though, that it’s only one list.  
        
     Reading this list and answering the questions above should take

    Copyright”](http://www.thecapitol.net/Publications/testifyingbeforecongress_Twain.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: We are living in an era when the ownership of
    intellectual property is under assault. We expect “content” to be
    free, and we’re not bashful about passing that content on to our
    “peers.” We don’t think of content as someone’s labor, someone who
    hopes to enjoy the fruits of that labor. Samuel Clemens had radical
    ideas about copyright, but his testimony before a congressional
    committee on what became the Copyright Act of 1909 is logical and
    well-reasoned − and funny.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The history of a publishing house is a curious mix of
    literary and commercial interests. The story of Random House Inc.
    begins in 1925 when two men in their 20s, Bennett Cerf and Donald
    Klopfer, bought a small line of books and turned it into a
    publishing giant. Read this history and note how the literary
    emphasis of the company shifted to a commercial one as the company
    grew and eventually went public.

**4.2.1 Pulp Fiction: Low-Brow Becomes High-Brow** <span
id="4.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: University of Buffalo: Patricia Donovan’s “Pulp
    Fiction”**
    Link: University of Buffalo: Patricia Donovan’s [“Pulp
    Fiction](http://www.buffalo.edu/UBT/UBT-archives/13_ubtw00/features/feature3.html)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: In February 1949, Russell Lynes wrote an article for
    *Harper’s* that divided American tastes into “highbrow, lowbrow, and
    middlebrow.” Lynes, Harper’s managing editor, later helped *Life*
    come up with a chart that placed things such as “reading” on a
    scale, from the highly intellectual (highbrow) to what he thought
    appealed to the uneducated lower classes (lowbrow).[1] On the chart,
    he classifies pulp magazines and comic books as the lowest of
    lowbrow.[1] But such distinctions are tricky because the so-called
    tastemakers can elevate something lowbrow by making it the topic of
    intellectual inquiry. Such is the case with much pulp fiction,
    written as entertainment and printed on cheap “pulp” paper, often
    with one eye on sales figures. Today, the detective novels of
    Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler are considered in literature
    classes alongside Hemingway. Read Patricia Donovan’s description of
    one bibliophile’s pulp-fiction collection.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

    Literature?](http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_3_what_use.html)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Myron Magnet’s article on the uses of literature is
    really a commentary on what it means to have a common culture. Note
    that Magnet never uses the term “entertainment,” but good literature
    to him has to touch us personally and speak some truth. That can be
    entertaining, too.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Remember that being media literate means knowing how
    media messages are constructed. Read Michael J. Vaughn’s analysis of
    what makes a best seller. Think also of how the techniques Vaughn
    suggests arise from our common culture.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: In Chapter 3, Section 1 (pages 107-118) of
    *Understanding Media and Culture*, you read that Harriet Beecher
    Stowe’s novel *Uncle Tom’s Cabin* had a profound effect on attitudes
    toward slavery and might have hastened the Civil War. Keep that in
    mind as you read Cynthia Wachtell’s well-researched opinion piece
    that makes a similar claim for the romantic tales of chivalry
    written by Sir Walter Scott.

     Instructions: Chapter 3, Section 3 on pages 115-120 summarizes how
    the publishing industry puts books in categories, such as hardcover,
    trade paperback, and paperback. As you read this, think of
    publishing and bookselling as a type of culture, with its own codes
    and rituals. These codes and rituals are changing rapidly; think of
    the demise of the cozy bookstore and the rise of Amazon. How has
    that affected your relationship with the object itself, the book?

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Michael Hyatt of the trade-book publisher Thomas
    Nelson says the ink-on-paper book is dead, and he has the video to
    prove it. But is reading a book on your Kindle substantially
    different from reading it on a printed page? Yes, Hyatt says, and
    it’s better.

     Instructions: The scholar Priscilla Coit Murphy points out that
    other media have survived in the face of technology. She states that
    our mistake is to think of various forms of media as rivals in a
    zero-sum world, where a movie sold means one less book sold. This
    isn’t true, she writes. As you read this, think about how different
    forms of media (books, movies, games) co-exist in your world.

     Instructions: This short article from *The Economist* discusses the
    rapid rate that information in books is being turned into electrons
    in a computer. Digitization is changing everything from how we read
    to what libraries own and provide.

     Instructions: We tend to think of the digital world of books in
    terms of reading new books on the Kindle or iPad. The uneasy
    relationship this has brought about between libraries and publishers
    has a note of irony, as Dennis Johnson points out in his article
    about Random House.
