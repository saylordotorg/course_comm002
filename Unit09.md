**Unit 9: The Virtual World of Games** <span id="9"></span> 
*In Unit 7, we discussed how movies, games and comic books coexist as
transmedia, where familiar characters inhabit familiar worlds in stories
dispersed across many types of media. At first, an electronic game might
be based on a popular movie or television show, such as* Star Wars*.
Today, the flow is just as likely to go the other way, with movies
portraying characters from popular games inhabiting their familiar game
worlds. For example, Angelina Jolie has starred in two movies as Lara
Croft, the game character first seen in the Square-Enix game series*
Tomb Raider*. Games have had a profound effect on other media, even
broadcasts of sports events. This unit will explore the world of games,
first looking at the technology, then the cultural aspects, concluding
with movements to use games as educational tools.*

    Jen-Hsun Huang, the co-founder and CEO of NVIDIA, discusses the
    history of his company and the challenges of innovation with Ina
    Fried. Where is mass media going? Huang thinks it will be to a new
    class of super cell phones.

     Instructions: The ability of consoles to sense participant motion
    came to video games when Nintendo introduced the Wii remote in 2006.
    Microsoft followed in 2010 with the Kinect motion sensor for Xbox.
    Unlike Wii, the Kinect did not require the game player to hold a
    device, as the Wii did. But both devices immediately found uses
    outside of the gaming world. Watch this fascinating video in which
    hacker Johnny Chung Lee adapts the Wii remote for the kind of
    computer hand control seen in the movie *Minority Report*.

     Instructions: When Microsoft introduced the Kinect motion-detection
    interface, it provided programmers and developers with a low-cost,

    Games”](http://youtu.be/l8I0Wy58adM) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: If you love video games, you have to be concerned
    about the issue of sexism in the games themselves. As the
    Entertainment Software Association notes, 47 percent of video game
    players are women, and this segment of the audience is growing fast.
    Anita Sarkeesian decided to turn her feminist point of view on games
    into a research project; watch her Kickstarter video soliciting
    funds to study female tropes in video games. Note that it received a
    spectacular response from contributors, almost $160,000 when she was
    asking for $6,000.

    of a trope and uses the movies to provide an example. Make sure you
    understand what she means by a “trope” and try to apply it to other

     Instructions: Read this article and look at the pictures and slides
    that go with it. Sarkeesian’s initiative on games drew a violent and

     Instructions: Amanda Marcotte believes that a violent sexism is
    deeply ingrained in gamer culture, and that has to change if for no
    other reason than women are as much into games as men. Connect this
    with what you read in the previous subunit. It is an example of how

     Instructions: Chapter 10, Section 5 on pages 468-474 sets the
    foundation for understanding how an entertainment medium such video
    games can become a way of spreading culture in ways not originally
    intended. As you read this section, think back to the unit on
    television: in its early days, many thought of television as a
    medium for education and the arts, but it soon branched out into a
    medium for news, sports, and entertainment. Is the medium of video
    games developing in a similar way?

     Instructions: In this paper, four proponents of video games in
    education discuss the promise and the issues of gaming in the
    schools. They argue that the most powerful learning experiences are
    personally meaningful and experiential, and that most educational
    games have been developed without any coherent educational theory.
    The authors then try to fill in the theoretical gap.
