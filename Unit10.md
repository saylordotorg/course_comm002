**Unit 10: Social Media** <span id="10"></span> 
*If something has been tweeted, is it still news? Apparently the British
Broadcasting Corporation believes the answer is no. In February 2012,
the corporation issued new rules to all of its correspondents,
reporters, and producers not to break news stories on Twitter before the
BBC newsroom knows about it.[[viii]](#_edn1) Journalists are just one
group struggling to harness the power of social media. Facebook has a
special place for businesses competing to be “liked” and “friended” by
users. Government, too, is involved in Facebook, giving rise to fears
that information on the site will be used for domestic surveillance. And
social media has changed the nature of political campaigns. Facebook
wasn’t 10 years old until 2013, yet it has more than 800 million users;
if Facebook were a country, it would be the third largest on Earth. This
unit will explore how the Internet has developed from a Defense
Department research project into a worldwide engine of commerce and
social change.*

    proposal for a worldwide hypertext system, Berners-Lee wrote, “We
    should work toward a universal linked information system, in which
    generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics
    techniques and complex extra facilities. The aim would be to allow a
    place to be found for any information or reference which one felt
    was important, and a way of finding it afterwards.”[1] Skim the
    proposal for yourself.

    education, entertainment – and how corporate control of the network
    might affect your experience.
