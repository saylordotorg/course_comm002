**Unit 6: Music, Radio, and the Soundtrack of Our Lives** <span
id="6"></span> 
*Recorded music and radio have enjoyed a special synergy almost since
they were invented. The wireless telegraph patented by Guglielmo Marconi
in 1897 transmitted the dots and dashes of Morse code. The development
of radio that could broadcast music, drama, lectures − and commercials −
paralleled the development of higher-fidelity recording techniques. For
generations of Americans, radio was the primary medium for listening to
their favorite music as it brought news and culture to the most remote
corners of the country. Musicologist Charles Hamm calls radio “the
constant companion of man.” [[iv]](#_edn1) In this unit, we will
consider recorded music and radio together while we explore other radio
formats, including the explosion in talk radio over the past 30
years.*

     Instructions: These sections on pages 236-251 present a succinct
    yet thorough history of recorded music. As you read through this,
    you will see that the fate of recorded music has been intertwined
    with the development of radio. Keep this in mind and try to connect
    the dots as you read the next subunit.

    “Chapter 7, Introduction: Terrestrial Radio Stumbles Into the
    Digital Age” and “Section 1: Evolution of Radio Broadcasting”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Radio has survived into the digital age because of
    its adaptability to changing times, as these sections on pages
    288-305 will demonstrate. Up until the advent of the Internet, radio
    was the electronic medium with the lowest entry cost, meaning almost
    anyone could start a station. In the subunits below, we’ll see how
    recorded music and radio have had a large impact on culture, with
    popular music playing a part in the racial history of the United
    States and talk radio taking on a major role in the political
    discourse of the nation.

    “Chapter 6, Section 2: The Reciprocal Nature of Music and Culture”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Chapter 6, Section 2 on pages 251-262 will set the
    groundwork for the discussion below. This section outlines how much
    of what we think of as popular music began with black musicians.
    This includes musical genres as diverse as the blues, rock and roll,
    jazz, and even popular classics from George Gershwin and others. Try
    to keep this information in mind as you study the subunits to
    follow.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 30

    Minstrelsy”](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/sfeature/sf_minstrelsy.html)(HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The history of popular music doesn’t begin with the
    invention of the phonograph. In Chapter 6, Section 2 of
    *Understanding Media and Culture*, you read how race has had a
    profound influence on American music. The influence of race on
    popular music dates back to before the Civil War with Stephen
    Foster, who the PBS says “virtually invented popular music as we
    recognize it today.” One of Foster’s influences was blackface
    minstrelsy, the practice of white actors and singers wearing black
    makeup and acting out the worst stereotypes of black people. It was
    a type of theater that survived well into the 20th century. In these
    sections of *The American Experience* website, historians discuss
    blackface minstrelsy and its lasting impact on American culture.  
        
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately
    30 minutes.

    Soul”](http://www.newyorker.com/online/2007/10/22/071022on_audio_frerejones)(MP3)  
        
     Instructions: For pop music critic Sasha Frere-Jones of *The New
    Yorker*, today’s music needs more soul. Frere-Jones makes the case
    that the development of pop music has relied to some extent on the
    ability of white musicians to synthesize influences from black
    music. But today singers are eschewing these influences, to the
    detriment of their music, Frere-Jones writes. Read his article and
    listen to his comments, including musical excerpts.  
        
     Reading the article and listening to the talk should take

     Instructions: This section on radio and culture on pages 310-323
    discusses the Fairness Doctrine and its repeal in 1987. This allowed
    radio talk show hosts to say whatever they wanted and gave birth to
    Rush Limbaugh, among others. In many ways, the divisive political
    culture we experience now is due in part to the repeal of the
    Fairness Doctrine and the highly partisan radio shows that resulted.
    Keep these readings in mind as you tackle the next subunits.

     Instructions: David Foster Wallace’s profile of conservative radio
    host John Ziegler is revealing in many ways. Wallace describes the
    technical innovations that make modern talk radio work as it does.
    He shows us what makes Ziegler tick. He places talk radio in the
    spectrum of political life, and he discusses the economic forces of
    the medium. It’s highly entertaining, but more than that, once you
    read it, you will have a much more media-literate picture of
    political talk radio.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour.

     Instructions: Rush Limbaugh, love him or hate him, pretty much
    invented conservative talk radio. The article by David Foster
    Wallace described Limbaugh’s formula and discussed his rise in the
    radio business. Nassira Nicola analyzes Limbaugh’s use of race as a
    code with his followers. It’s a revealing portrait of Limbaugh and
    his methods.

     Instructions: *The Los Angeles Times*, considered part of the
    liberal mainstream media by Limbaugh and his followers, makes a case
    for Limbaugh’s having real power with conservatives. The authors say
    that Limbaugh during the 2008 election was “unchanged and unbowed.
    If anything, his prominence and political import have increased.” Do
    you agree? Read this story carefully, and then follow up with
    conservative columnists David Brooks’s rebuttal in the next
    subunit.

     Instructions: Because digital production of a record or album is so
    inexpensive, a service such as iTunes can house thousands of artists
    who might sell very few songs. Together, those thousands of artists,
    who reside in the *long tail* of the distribution business, add up

    the name Owl City. Using MySpace and iTunes, he increased his sales
    to about 2,000 tracks a week, and then his single “Fireflies” surged
    to the top of the Billboard charts. His story is one of how artists
    need new and old media to reach stardom starting in the *long tail*
    of the music business.

     Instructions: *Understanding Media and Culture* notes that radio
    has remained relevant through decades of technological change
    because of its flexibility in adapting formats and programming.
    Pandora, an Internet station that listeners customize to their
    listening tastes, is the latest challenge to terrestrial radio
    stations. How will terrestrial radio respond?
