**Unit 2: Media Effects** <span id="2"></span> 
*According to a 2010 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, children 8
to 18 years old use entertainment media for an average of 7 hours 38
minutes in a typical day, more than 53 hours a week. For much of that
time, children are using more than one medium, so they are exposed to 10
hours 45 minutes of media content in those 7½ hours.[[i]](#_edn1)
Children are the most impressionable of media consumers, but the media
and their content affect our entire culture. This unit will cover a few
of the main theories of media effects, but as you’ll discover, these
theories are controversial in that media effects are so difficult to
study.*

    From Detroit”](http://youtu.be/SKL254Y_jtc) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Propaganda differs from advertising in that
    propaganda’s goal is to change opinions while advertising’s goal is
    to sell a product. But what do you make of this commercial,
    considered by many the best from the 2011 Super Bowl? What claims is
    the advertiser making about the city of Detroit? The advertiser
    obviously believes changing opinions about a city is as important as
    selling the product.

     Instructions: As you read the study from *Pediatrics* on the
    effects of media consumption on teenage sexual behavior, keep in
    mind what you heard from Kojo Nnamdi and his guests. The article is
    typical of media-effects research and is heavy on statistics. Skim

     Instructions: Chapter 2, Section 2 on pages 70-77 provides good
    summaries of media effects theories. Communication research journals
    include hundreds of studies using agenda setting, uses and
    gratification, symbolic interactionism, spiral of silence, media
    logic, or cultivation analysis for a theoretical basis. Try to form
    an understanding of each theory, and then concentrate especially on
    cultivation analysis.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Review this study that was assigned in subunit
    2.1.3.2, this time concentrating on the theoretical section. What
    assumptions does cultivation theory make about audiences and how
    they watch and absorb content?

    Question”](http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/tv-violence-and-art-asking-wrong-question) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This article by George Gerbner and the study from the
    journal *Pediatrics* both use cultivation analysis to explore
    “whether those who spend more time with television are more likely
    than lighter viewers to perceive the real world in ways that reflect
    common and repetitive features of the television world,” as
    Professor Gerbner writes. Cultivation analysis has been the dominant
    theory used by those who crusade against sex and violence in the
    media, as is the case in these two readings. As we’ll see later, the
    use of this research sometimes has created controversy.  
        
     Reviewing this article and taking notes should take approximately
    15 minutes.

     Instructions: Chapter 2, Section 3 on pages 78-83 provides a
    summary of methods used to test communication theories. Each method
    has a profound effect on the results and how results are analyzed.
    Beyond the need for integrity in research, a focus group produces a
    much different type of data than a paper-and-pencil questionnaire,
    with different avenues for interpretation.  
        
     Reading this section and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read these three short summaries of cause-and-effect
    reasoning. A valid media-effects study must be constructed carefully
    if cause and effect are to be inferred. As we will see in the next
    subunit, saying that media causes violence, teen pregnancy, or other
    undesirable behavior can be difficult to prove and can create
    controversy.

     Instructions: Go back over the claims made in this article on
    television and teen sexual behavior. Review the methods and ask what
    things the researchers did to ensure that any conclusion about cause
    and effect are valid.

     Instructions: By now you should be familiar with the study on
    television viewing and teen sexual behavior. The press release from
    Temple University describes another study of the data in which the
    investigator, Laurence Steinberg, comes to a somewhat different
    conclusion, based on the idea of an intervening variable. He also
    touches on the idea that all of us negotiate our own meaning from
    what we see in the media, one of the principles of media literacy.
