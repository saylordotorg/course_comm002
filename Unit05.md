**Unit 5: Newspapers and Magazines in a Changing World** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Newspapers and magazines sometimes are called “legacy media”: media
that existed before the Internet, for centuries in the case of
newspapers and magazines. Calling the newspaper a “legacy” also implies
that its time has passed. But newspapers and magazines persist, despite
severe economic pressure. The unfolding of the newspaper over morning
coffee is still a ritual many of us enjoy. Printed forms of magazines
and newspapers also survive for economic reasons: the online versions
still do not generate the advertising dollars needed to run large
newsgathering operations. In this unit, we will examine the important
democratic functions newspapers and magazines have served in the United
States, and we will analyze how those functions might be affected by the
inevitable shift to online distribution. As you study this unit, keep
one thought in mind: ink on paper is a delivery system, and the real
question is, will journalism survive as newspapers and magazines
decline*

**5.1.1 The History of Newspapers** <span id="5.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Understanding Media and Culture*: “Chapter 4,
    Introduction: Newspaper Wars” and “Section 1: History of
    Newspapers”**
    Link: *[Understanding Media and
    Culture](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/Understanding%20Media%20and%20Culture.pdf)*:
    “Chapter 4, Introduction: Newspaper Wars” and “Section 1: History of
    Newspapers” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: These two sections on pages 143-157 provide detailed
    histories of newspapers. In many ways, magazines and newspapers
    started from the same place but evolved into different media based
    on something as simple as how often each was published. Newspapers
    became an immediate source of news. In subunits to follow, we’ll see
    how newspapers have been slow to change, and how they are paying the
    price today.  
        
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately
    30 minutes.

**5.1.2 The History of Magazines** <span id="5.1.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Understanding Media and Culture*: “Chapter 5,
    Introduction: Changing Times, Changing Tastes” and “Section 1:
    History of Magazine Publishing”**
    Link: [*Understanding Media and
    Culture*](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/Understanding%20Media%20and%20Culture.pdf):
    “Chapter 5, Introduction: Changing Times, Changing Tastes” and
    “Section 1: History of Magazine Publishing” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 5’s Introduction and Section 1 on pages
    191-201. Magazines as printed documents probably have a greater
    chance of survival than newspapers because of the specialized roles
    they have played in American culture. While a newspaper tries to be
    all things to all people, magazines can serve niche audiences with
    articles that conform to the *slant* of readers. But magazines face
    challenges, too, in a world of electronic readers and the Internet.
    As you study the following subunits, try to connect your readings
    with these chapter sections.  
        
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately
    30 minutes.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The story of the Yellow Kid is the story of
    newspapers becoming a mass medium. Mary Wood’s thorough treatment of
    the subject provides a glimpse of the first efforts to attract
    readers of all social classes, of the connection of cartoons with
    everyday life, and of the origins of the newspaper comic strip.

    November 3, 1948, Chicago Daily
    Tribune](http://www.historybuff.com/library/refdewey.html)” (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Over the first half of the 20th Century, the golden
    age of newspapers, the medium went unchallenged as the first place
    people went to learn about current events − news as it happened. In
    1948, the *Chicago Tribune* put out 11 editions; on many days,
    extras (extra editions to trumpet breaking news) were common. R. J.
    Brown analyzes the editions of the Tribune on one fateful day:
    Election Day 1948.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: As the audience for newspapers grew, newspapers
    adopted a more objective style of writing, and the *inverted
    pyramid* story form was born. It is an example of how the medium
    shapes the message, and of how a medium adapted to becoming a mass
    medium. This style of writing is still useful today for much of what
    we read on the Internet.

    Newspapers”**
    Link: Olivia Grayson-Kirk’s [“Comparing Tabloid and Broadsheet
    Newspapers](http://www.slideshare.net/ogk_x/comparing-tabloid-and-broadsheet)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The terms *tabloid* and *broadsheet* refer to the two
    main formats of newspapers. A broadsheet (*The New York Times*) is
    about 22 inches tall and about 11½ inches wide. A tabloid (*The New
    York Post*) is about 11 inches by 11½ inches, essentially a
    broadsheet folded in half and read like a book. The first tabloids,
    and many that we see today at supermarket checkout, specialized in
    sensational news, heavy on celebrity. The term *tabloid journalism*
    has been applied to television shows on the E! Network, radio shows
    such as *Coast to Coast A.M.,* and magazines such as *People*. This
    student presentation compares a story about auto-racing journalist
    Jeremy Clarkson in two British newspapers. You’ll see the difference
    immediately.  
        
     Viewing this presentation should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Also available in:

     Instructions: In the first half of the 20th Century, newspapers had
    changed little from those being printed in 1900. Michael O’Donnell’s
    article makes the claim that newspaper editors had fallen victim to
    “superstitious learning.” Because newspapers had remained
    profitable, editors saw the crowded, gray newspaper page as not just
    correct, but morally correct, like a religion. The article describes
    one of the first efforts to drag newspapers into the modern age of
    typography and design. Note that the designer Frank Ariss had to
    deal with many cultures at the *Minneapolis Tribune*: journalism,
    advertising, accounting, and production.

     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: John G. Morris was there for “the golden age of
    photojournalism,” as a picture editor for *Life*, *The Ladies’ Home
    Journal*, *The Washington Post*, and *The New York Times*, and as
    executive editor for Magnum, the photography cooperative. This short
    history will illustrate the major role photojournalism played in
    making magazines into a cultural force.

    (PDF) and “Section 3: How Newspapers Control the Public’s Access to
    Information and Impact American Pop Culture” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: In writing about newspapers, the author emphasizes
    the duties of journalism in a free society. His emphasis in Section
    2, on pages 158-169, and Section 3, on pages 169-174, reinforces the
    perception that for many in the field of media education, newspapers
    *are* journalism, even though one of his major categories of
    magazines is the news magazine. As you read this section of the
    textbook, think about how newspaper industry’s decline might be
    affecting the news we read and view, not just how news comes to us
    but the content of that news.  
        
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour.

     Instructions: In Chapter 5, Section 2 (pages 201-208), Section 3
    (208-217), and Section 4 (217-221), the author emphasizes culture,
    especially pop culture, in his discussion of magazines. In Section
    5.4, as he did in Section 4.3 for newspapers, he discusses how
    magazines control information. Ask yourself: in the age of the
    Internet, is this still a valid idea?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and then click on the
    link titled “View in iTunes” beside podcast 9. Gay Talese is one of
    the founding fathers of new journalism, what *Understanding Media
    and Culture* calls by its alternate name, literary journalism. The
    new journalism is 50 years old now, but the practice of it still
    seems fresh. Talese starts his discussion by relating a story about
    a bridge that turns into one of the hallmarks of literary
    journalism, the telling of stories about everyday people to
    illustrate the issues of our society.  
        
     Listening to this audio podcast and taking notes should take
    approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: This survey by the First Amendment Center shows that
    the American public still holds the watchdog function of the press
    in high regard. Will this continue as newspapers and magazines
    continue to decline economically?

    “Chapter 5, Section 5: Specialization of Magazines” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 5, Section 5 on pages 222-228. One thing
    that separates magazines from newspapers is the *slant*, or
    editorial point of view. This isn’t the same thing as a bias,
    although many magazines have biases. Slant can be defined for a
    writer as “another layer of meaning in a work, aligned with the
    perceived needs of the target audience.”[1] The author writes about
    magazines as specialized publications, another way to think of the
    slant.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Magazines engage in extensive audience research, but
    unlike newspapers, the findings of this research affect the content
    of the magazine, from the types of articles printed to the way they
    are written. That’s why beginning writers are urged to read back
    issues of a magazine and look over the media kit before submitting
    an article. Imagine you are that writer. What would your approach be
    for *Ladies Home Journal*?

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: News and “newspapers” are not one and the same. The
    Pew Research Center states that 2008 was the first year in which
    more people got their news online than on paper. Note that in the

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The news about newspapers is grim. Some are in an
    economic death spiral, cutting staff to survive, and then losing
    readers to a poorer quality product. Some, like the *Washington
    Post*, saw the writing on the screen years ago and started
    diversifying to lessen reliance on the print product. As you read
    this, think back to the idea of vertical integration, where one
    company owns all the parts in the production and distribution chain.
    Is that what the *Post* is doing?

     Instructions: A tablet computer, such as the iPad, and e-readers,
    such as the Kindle Fire, offer something a conventional website
    cannot: a way to get users to pay up front. Many newspapers have
    tried to use pay walls on their websites to generate income, with
    varying success. Our culture of being web users is such that we
    expect webpages to be free. But we are already conditioned to buying
    apps for our tablets and smart phones. Read the article from *Ad
    Age* about how media giant News Corps. is trying to exploit this
    culture of distribution.  
        
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

     Instructions: Now read the rest of the story. Audiences are
    difficult to build in today’s world of fragmented, niche media. And
    although tablet computers are becoming more and more popular, *The
    Daily* suffered from limiting its reach to those who owned one.
