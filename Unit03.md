**Unit 3: Advertising and the Market Society** <span id="3"></span> 
*In* Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass
Communication*, the author places advertising toward the end of the book
and spends fewer words on it than he does on many other chapters. But
advertising is in many respects the most important and pervasive of the
cultural industries we call “mass media.” All media organizations need
money to survive, even nonprofit media outlets such as National Public
Radio. Most of that money comes from either traditional advertising or
corporate “support.” Subscriptions and newsstand sales account for a
small percent of income for magazines and newspapers. The ticket-driven
medium of motion pictures relies on advertising as an important source
of revenue, through in-theater ads and product placement. Television and
radio are paid for almost exclusively through advertisement. In 2011,
expenditures for advertising totaled $144 billion, according to Kantar
Media.[[ii]](#_edn1) Advertising agencies draw on the top creative
talent to produce sophisticated and, yes, entertaining commercial
messages. To understand mass communication organizations, the first step
is to understand advertising. This unit also will cover public
relations, once seen as separate from advertising. Many advertising
firms today offer integrated marketing communications, in which
advertising and public relations functions “work closely together to
deliver a single seamless solution − a cohesive message − an integrated
message.”[[iii]](#_edn2)*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This article, one of the most-read ever published in
    *The Atlantic*, describes the “A Diamond Is Forever” advertising
    campaign and subsequent campaigns for DeBeers, the diamond cartel.
    It is a fascinating look at how advertising shapes culture, to the
    benefit of businesses that serve our culture. The assignment is to
    read about half of the article, down to the paragraph that begins,
    “A serious threat to the stability of the diamond invention came in
    the late 1970s from the sale of ‘investment’ diamonds to speculators
    in the United States.” You might find the article so interesting
    that you’ll read the whole of it. What does the article illustrate
    about how advertising is constructed, the goals of an advertising
    campaign and the effects of advertising on culture?

    Scott”](http://youtu.be/LIxog089lkA) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This famous commercial aired only once to a general
    audience, during the 1984 Super Bowl. It started two trends: the
    “high concept” advertising campaign that sells through emotion,
    identification, or loyalty building rather than through any claims
    about a product’s quality or value; and the Super Bowl halftime as a
    showcase for the advertising arts. In the second video, director
    Ridley Scott explains how he approached the commercial as he would a
    feature film, another trend that has continued.

    Super Bowl advertising. Amanda Bower’s comments are instructive
    about the new landscape of advertising that includes a mix of social
    media and online “webisodes” that we’ll read about later. She also
    notes that the Super Bowl provides a “common experience” such as we
    used to get from all of us watching the same shows on the same three
    networks. Keep this in mind as you read about the changing landscape
    of media in units to come.

     Instructions: When you open Professor Jhally’s webpage of audio and
    video, scroll down about halfway to the link “Advertising and the
    End of the World.” As you listen, recall what Professor Terry Dugas
    said, that some people consider advertising to be a great social
    evil. Jhally, one of the leading critics of modern media, states
    that a society based on consumption cannot sustain itself, and that
    advertising is the engine that drives consumption. Pay special
    attention to what he says about how advertising links goods to our
    personal happiness.

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: “The Human Element” was an advertising and public
    relations campaign begun by The Dow Chemical Company in 2007-2008.
    It is an example of many things discussed in your video lectures and
    textbook, such as positioning and soft sell. The campaign also
    represented an attempt at “greenwashing,” the practice of portraying
    a company as environmentally conscious and active through
    advertising and public relations, when the opposite might be true.
    Watch a long version of the ad, then turn to Dow’s YouTube channel
    to see how the company is using the Internet and social media to
    reach the public.  
        
     Watching these videos and taking notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: The Dow Chemical Company asked Anna Lappé, an
    advocate for clean water and sustainability, to contribute a video
    for a conference on water sustainability sponsored by Dow. But when
    her article was critical of Dow, the company refused to run it at
    the conference. Read this article and watch the video she submitted
    for an “exposé” of Dow’s greenwashing.

    economic terms? These two website pages lay out the dollar amounts,
    and they are astounding. Read the first page, “US Ad Spend Reported
    Up in ‘11,” for a summary of what was spent in 2011 by medium. As
    you read, you might notice the continuing migration of advertising
    dollars from print and other “legacy” media to online. The second
    page, “Top Advertisers of 2010,” provides a list of the top 10
    advertisers. Topping the list is Proctor & Gamble at *$3.1 billion*

     Instructions: “Self-regulation” sounds like the wolf guarding the
    hen house, but self-regulation can be effective in promoting good
    advertising practices, as this reading contends. Self-regulation has
    worked well in other areas of the media, such as the Motion Picture
    Association of America’s film ratings, the “PG,” “R,” and “NC-17”
    ratings you see on movie trailers. The idea is one of transparency
    rather than censorship.

     Instructions: After reading *Understanding Media and Culture*,
    Chapter 12, Section 2, read Michael Turnley’s explanation of how
    advertising, marketing, and public relations are becoming one thing:
    integrated marketing communication. A driving force in this movement
    has been economic; major advertising agencies have been buying up
    public relations firms, as well as other smaller ad agencies. Recall
    that in *The Persuaders*, advertising people talked about the
    importance of branding and other ways of promoting a product beyond
    the traditional advertising “buys.” Many of these activities come
    from the PR world.

     Instructions: The historian Daniel Boorstin defined a “pseudo
    event” as an event held for the sole purpose of attracting the media
    and getting across a public relations message. Read Michael
    Turnley’s lessons on perception, television, and the “pseudo
    event.”

     Instructions: On May 1, 2003, a jet plane landed on the aircraft
    carrier Abraham Lincoln with the president of the United States
    aboard. Elisabeth Bumiller of *The New York Time*s called it “one of
    the most audacious moments of presidential theater in American
    history.” President Bush’s carrier landing seemed brilliant at the
    time, but he later admitted that it was a mistake in that it created
    false expectations. This video revisits the “Mission Accomplished”
    speech five years later.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Elisabeth Bumiller analyzes how the Bush strategists
    were masters of creating the scenes that resulted in beautiful,
    forceful images of the president. As you read her article, think
    back to what Professor Michael Turnley wrote about the
    “pseudo-event.”

     Instructions: Look at the Obama YouTube channel, remembering what
    was said in *The Persuaders* about advertising moving to YouTube in
    the form of short videos and “webisodes.” Spend 10 minutes or more
    seeing the types of video and other things on the site that
    encourage interactivity.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The 2008 presidential campaign has been called the
    first “Internet” campaign, and much has been written analyzing the
    branding and websites of the two candidates, John McCain and Barack
    Obama. Claire Cane Miller, among others, wrote that Obama’s “use of
    a new medium…will forever change politics,” just as John F.
    Kennedy’s use of television did in 1960. It started with a brilliant
    logo and branding campaign and continued with a website that took
    advantage of “web 2.0” and the tools of social media.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: You’ll enjoy Sutton’s humorous yet instructive take
    on campaign logos, but pay attention to his analysis of the visual
    cues he sees. People at ad agencies who “brand” products agonize
    over such details as choice of typeface, knowing that these details
    contribute to the overall message in subtle but important ways.

    “Section 13.1: Characteristics of Media Industries” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: As government regulations on media ownership have
    been relaxed, media companies have merged and remerged into giant
    conglomerates that control market segments vertically, owning
    companies that produce content, those that distribute content and
    the channels that show content. Some see a danger in so much control
    over what we see in so few hands. As you read these Sections on
    pages 587-596, ask yourself: what could be the harm in having such
    control over various segments of the industry?  
        
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately
    30 minutes.

     Instructions: Newspapers, magazines, television, radio channels,
    and websites are being concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer
    companies. Today, six huge corporations own a massive stake in US
    media: CBS, Comcast, News Corp., Time Warner, Viacom, and Walt
    Disney. Some executives of these companies, such as Rupert Murdoch
    of News Corp., aren’t afraid to use their ownership as a tool of
    political and economic power. On the *Columbia Journalism Review*
    page, click the button labeled, “Select a media company...” then
    look over the holdings of these six corporations.

     Instructions: In the recent past, going to a bookstore was a
    cultural experience in and of itself. The people running small
    bookstores did it for the love of books, and although their
    selection might be limited by modern standards, the stores were
    homey places where you might sit in an old armchair and preview a
    new release. The big-box bookstores tried to capture some of that
    ambience but with a massive inventory; you could sit in that
    armchair and command thousands of titles. David Streitfeld describes
    how the Barnes & Nobles store, too, might soon be a thing of the
    past.

     Instructions: Is the Internet like the Wild West? Some economists
    think so, with rustling of intellectual property the crime of
    choice. This section on pages 654-662 provides a good overview of
    some of the issues we face in the information economy, including how
    a few huge media companies have come to dominate the marketplace.
    While you might find it difficult to feel sorry for a media
    conglomerate, keep this chapter in mind as you move on to the next
    subunit on piracy.

    “Chapter 13, Section 5: Globalization and the Media” and “Section 6:
    Cultural Imperialism” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: The author discusses at length the ideas of
    globalization in Section 5 on pages 614-618, and cultural
    imperialism in Section 6 on pages 618-623. Certainly globalization
    has led to the spread of culture across national boundaries, but
    does one culture really “colonize” another, or is the process more
    complicated? For example, the textbook discusses the
    “McDonaldization” of the media in countries across the globe. In the
    end, the author states that the flow of information and its effects
    on culture are too complex for one simple explanation.

     Instructions: The concept of hybrid culture provides a more nuanced
    analysis of the flow of culture across national boundaries. Consider
    for example the counter-flow of culture to the US – think Pokémon or
    manga. Straubhaar presents a more detailed look at what happens when
    our cultures all become one big culture.
