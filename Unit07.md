**Unit 7: Movies in a Transmedia World** <span id="7"></span> 
*What’s more heroic, saving the world from evil or making a billion
dollars in little more than two weeks? If you’re Walt Disney Pictures,
definitely it’s the latter.* The Avengers*brought in $207.4 million in
its first weekend at the end of April 2012 and broke the $1 billion
barrier two weekends later.[[v]](#_edn1)The film featured the Marvel
comic-book characters Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk,
among others. As movie-making has become more and more expensive,
studios have sought tested story lines that provide viewers with a sense
of familiarity and puts them immediately in the action. Comic books
provide rich, well-developed worlds and strong characters that can be
exploited through transmedia, in which “a fiction get dispersed
systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of
creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience,” in the
words of Henry Jenkins.[[vi]](#_edn2) Transmedia involves synergies,
such as the one between comic-book makers and film studios. Iron Man has
three movies of his own, the comic book (of course), a video game, and
websites, including one that features an online game for younger
children. In 2011, studios released 10 films based on comic-book heroes,
including several animated features.[[vii]](#_edn3) The heavy reliance
on comic books for movie scripts is just the latest example of how
culture and movies are intertwined. In the subunits below, we will
examine several movies that demonstrate this interaction. We will delve
into the history of motion pictures and examine the economic, social,
and technological forces that have shaped this powerful cultural
medium.*

    “Chapter 8, Introduction: Are 3-D Effects Creating Two-Dimensional
    Films?” and “Section 1: The History of Movies” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: These sections of *Understanding Media and Culture*
    on pages 330-350 provide a succinct history of motion pictures. It
    is a history of parallel tracks: the constant technological drive to
    add to the spectacle and realism of movies, and the creative drive
    to use movies as a form of expression. Both of these tracks were
    there from the start, and each strongly affected the other. Think,
    for example, of the impact sound had on movies. Technology also
    affected how we watch movies, as the readings on Cinerama show. The
    trend continues today with the move to digital presentation.  
        
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately
    45 minutes.

**7.1.1 Key Films in the Early Days of Motion Pictures** <span
id="7.1.1"></span> 
*The films discussed in the following subunits cover the first 20 years
of movie making, from Thomas Edison’s* The Sneeze*, believed to be the
earliest copyrighted film, to D. W. Griffith’s three-hour spectacular*
Birth of a Nation*.*

    Sneeze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wnOpDWSbyw) *(YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: “Fred Ott’s Sneeze” (1894) was the first motion
    picture to be copyrighted in the United States, according to the
    Internet Movie Database. As with the films you’ll watch from the
    Lumière Brothers, the subject matter is a simple act of everyday
    life, a sneeze. Audiences were thrilled not by the story line, but
    by the simple act of seeing moving images.  
        
     Watching this video should take approximately 2 minutes.

     Instructions: The Lumière Brothers developed a lightweight camera,
    the cinématographe, that also could make prints of movies and show
    the films to audiences. Then they sent their own people around the
    world to shoot and show slices of life from faraway places. Watch
    some of these early films.  
        
     Watching this video should take approximately 5 minutes.

     Instructions: Watch the short documentary about how the Lumière
    brothers conceived of the first vertically integrated motion-picture
    company. The next step for them would have been developing talent to
    produce feature films, a step they never took.  
        
     Watching these videos should take you approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Georges Méliès, a stage magician by trade, saw the
    potential for magical storytelling in motion pictures. He is
    credited with using the first double exposure, stop-camera, and
    dissolves. Méliès made more than 500 films, financing, directing,
    photographing and starring in nearly every one.[1]

     Instructions: Watch as much of “The Birth of a Nation” as you have
    time, but note the depiction of slave life in the South at about the
    15-minute mark, the major battle scene about 50 minutes into the
    movie, and the controversial ending, in which the Ku Klux Klan makes
    a heroic charge to the rescue. Griffith put the camera in the
    action, taking it out of the studio for grandly staged battles. But
    the racial overtones of his film overshadow its technique.  
        
     Watching portions of this video should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: After you’ve watched some of the key parts of *The
    Birth of a Nation*, read some of the reaction to Griffith’s film.
    It’s instructive that white actors in black makeup played all of the
    key roles of slaves.

    (1948)](http://archive.org/details/LetsGoToTheM) *(HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Watch these videos of historic talking movies. The
    first is a test reel produced by Lee DeForest, who also was a
    pioneer in the development of television. It features Eddie Cantor,
    a popular vaudeville performer who had his own television show in
    the 1950s. The second video is a summary of the history of movie
    technology. About two minutes into the video, you’ll see part of the
    climactic number from the first talking movie, *The Jazz Singer*, in
    which Al Jolson dons blackface makeup and sings “Mammy.”  
        
     Watching these videos should take approximately 15 minutes.

     In the subunits that follow, you will see how race has been a
    sensitive issue throughout the history of movies. *The Jazz Singer*
    was just one example of the continued use of blackface − white
    actors wearing black makeup and acting stereotypically “black,” a
    type of entertainment that dates from before the Civil War. Watch
    this discussion of the subject that includes video of blackface in
    the movies.

     Instructions: The ideal movie technology would be virtual reality,
    but falling short of that, a goal of movie technicians has been to
    surround the viewer as much as possible, with the moving image and
    with sound. Wide-screen methods such as Cinemascope, VistaVision,
    and Todd-AO were developed to engage the viewer’s peripheral vision,
    thus making the experience more realistic. These techniques used
    special lenses to compress a wide field of view, then special
    projection lenses to widen the movie in the theater.

     Instructions: This article from the 1950s will explain the complex
    three-camera system called Cinerama. It enjoyed a short, spectacular
    run of about 20 years that included building special theaters around
    the country. As you read the article, think about the parallel with

     In the subunit above, we saw how wide-screen technology changed the
    culture of how we got to the movies. People in the 1950s and ‘60s
    left the small-town theater behind and visited a special high-tech
    theater in the city, such as the Cooper in suburban Minneapolis and
    the River Hills in Des Moines, Iowa. In this article, Nicholson
    Baker provides an entertaining account on the life of the
    projectionist, and he describes how new technology, the platter
    projector, made the multiscreen theater possible, changing again the
    culture of how we go to the movies. Today, with digital technology
    making its way into theaters, the job of projectionist may soon be a
    thing of the past.

     Instructions: How will movie theaters attract us if we all have
    huge flat-screen televisions showing high-definition digital video?
    The way they always have: shock and awe. The astounding screen size
    of the IMAX theater and the improved gimmickry of 3D allow theaters
    to charge a premium price for tickets. As you’ll read, it’s so
    lucrative that IMAX has developed a complex and expensive process to
    convert regular 35mm movie film to the sideways running 70mm IMAX
    stock.

    “Chapter 8, Section 2: Movies and Culture” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Chapter 8, Section 2 on pages 350-358 describes the
    cultural forces acting on the film industry and the ways films
    affect our culture. In the subunits to follow, you will read about a
    revolutionary year in Hollywood, 1967, when four films forever
    changed how movies were made. These films changed our culture, too.
    From that year on, producers and directors felt a new freedom to
    follow their vision, leaving behind the cultural restraints of the
    past. *Bonnie and Clyde* begat *The Godfather;* *The Graduate* begat
    *Alice’s Restaurant*. Today, movies routinely portray interracial
    relationships, but in 1967, *Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner* was
    shocking to many. *In the Heat of the Night* gave birth to a new
    image of the African-American male actor, one fulfilled by Will
    Smith, Samuel L. Jackson, and Laurence Fishburne. Those four films,
    along with the old-school, big-budget *Dr. Dolittle*, made up the
    1987 Academy Award nominees for Best Picture.

     Instructions: *Bonnie and Clyde*, directed by Arthur Penn, took the
    daring step of making notorious outlaws the anti-heroes of a tale of
    class warfare. With its overt violence, sexual tension, and zany
    bluegrass sound track, it was like nothing before it. Like many such
    movies, it was controversial even as it was being made. This reading
    discusses some of the thought and process that went into making
    Bonnie and Clyde.

     Instructions: For those who love movies, *Bonnie and Clyde* is a
    must watch. The trailer gives you a taste of how the movie was
    marketed, and the short clip provides some idea of the themes that
    ran through the movie: the publicity-seeking outlaws trading on
    Depression-era resentment of the rich. Watch the trailers and clip,
    and you’ll get the idea.

    some of the highs and lows of the creative process. Particularly
    telling is director Mike Nichols’s comments that he knew he was onto
    something different and great. His comment illustrates the media
    literacy idea that media texts are made with a purpose to achieve

     Instructions: In 1967, the earliest members of the postwar Baby

     Instructions: Director Stanley Kramer’s movie is about a liberal
    couple, played by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, who learn
    that their daughter wants to marry a black man, Sidney Poitier. It’s
    a bit of a setup: Poitier is a handsome, urbane doctor who is
    working to stomp out tropical diseases. He’s the kind of guy any
    mother would want her daughter to marry. *New York Times* columnist
    Frank Rich, writing about it in 2008, sarcastically called it
    “Hollywood’s idea of a stirring call for racial justice.” [1] But in
    1967, interracial marriage was still illegal in 17 states until the
    Supreme Court struck down the laws in June of that year. And up to
    that time, roles even remotely suggesting the superiority of a black
    male character would have been unheard of. Donald Bogle will discuss
    how this movie began to restore sexuality to black male
    characters.

     Instructions: Mark Harris in his *Slate* article calls *In the Heat
    of the Night* a “liberal message movie that worked,” mostly because
    it had great direction and great actors in Rod Steiger and Sydney
    Poitier. His article also describes the harsh reaction from critics
    who thought the message of racial reconciliation was unrealistic.
    Those old enough will remember that the Civil Rights Movement still
    had much to accomplish in 1967, and stories of racial violence in
    the South added to the tension of watching this film when it came
    out.

     Instructions: The clip from the movie shows one of its most
    important scenes, when the black detective played by Sydney Poitier
    confronts a well-heeled racist. It shocked audiences in 1967;
    remember, the nation was just a few years away from the violence
    visited on the Freedom Riders.

    book, *Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the
    New Hollywood*, describes the antics of Rex Harrison, the star of
    *Dr. Dolittle*. Harris includes it in his book as the prime example
    of the type of movies that were overthrown in his “revolution” by
    the other four movies nominated for Best Picture of the 1968 Academy
    Awards. Bosley Crowther’s review, dripping with sarcasm, was typical
    of the reception this movie received.

    realize it isn’t easy being the Walt Disney Co. When Walt Disney

     Instructions: Watch these segments about the origins of Disneyland.
    The theme park was Walt Disney’s “move from film to dimensional
    entertainment,” as these videos tell you. The various “lands” of the
    original Disneyland (Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Adventureland,
    Fantasyland and Main Street USA) became segments on Walt’s
    personally hosted television show, *The Wonderful World of Disney*,
    a show that also promoted Disney movies. Disney’s genius was to see
    all of it as one piece, a transmedia “world” of his creation, right
    down to the kitschy nostalgia of Main Street USA, modeled on his
    home town of Marceline, Missouri, but really an idealized memory
    rather than something real. Disney’s concept of horizontal
    integration had one drawback: if one part of the puzzle fails, it
    reflects on the whole enterprise.
