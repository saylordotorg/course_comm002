**Unit 8: Television Anytime, Anywhere** <span id="8"></span> 
*Perhaps the most radical change in television viewing for anyone who
grew up with the medium has been the freeing of the viewing schedule
from the bonds of time. If you wanted to watch the Jeffersons movin’ on
up in 1979, you had to be in front of your set promptly at 9:30 (Eastern
time) Saturday evenings. That changed with the advent of videocassette
recorders in the early 1980s. Today, the digital video recorder allows
you to record Mad Men automatically, pause the show while you make a
sandwich, then fast-forward through the commercials. This time shifting
now has been joined by place shifting. Devices such as Slingbox record
digital video in a compressed format and send it over the Internet to
anywhere you might be. You can watch on a computer, Internet-connected
television set, even your mobile phone. This unit explores the
development of this powerful medium, one that has shaped our culture as
much as we’ve shaped it.*

    Farnsworth”](http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/farnsworth.html)(HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The story of Philo Farnsworth is dramatic if only
    because of his background as a self-taught inventor. In 1922 as an
    Idaho teenager, he sketched out one of the first schemes for
    electronic television. Although he is credited as one of
    television’s inventors, he did not share in the tremendous profits
    television generated over the decades for companies such as RCA.

    Television,” the origins of television as told through RCA’s eyes.
    David Sarnoff talks with Vladimir Zworykin about television’s early
    development at RCA, but it leaves out RCA’s patent battle with Philo
    Farnsworth.

     Instructions: In this short excerpt from his book *Being Digital*,
    Nicholas Negroponte states that high definition is less important in
    the digital world than digital delivery systems that allow viewers
    to shift the time and place of where they watch. Writing in 1994, he
    states that the uses of television and the computer will become
    indistinguishable, predicting the rise of YouTube, Hulu, and other
    digital video websites. As we will see in the subunits below, much
    of what he says has come to pass. Television executives have tended
    to see digital technology as gimmicks, according to John
    Hockenberry, allowing themselves to be outflanked by cable and
    satellite companies, and by the Internet.

     Instructions: Television executive Lauren Zalaznick describes how
    television reflects our public conscience by tracking the content of
    the top-rated television shows over a period of 50 years. She makes
    a compelling case that television doesn’t create our culture; it
    reflects culture. As you listen to her, think back to cultivation
    analysts such as George Gerbner, who might say the effect goes in
    the opposite direction.

     Instructions: Newton Minow hadn’t been on the job as FCC
    commissioner for more than a few months when he delivered this
    speech to the convention of the National Association of Broadcasters
    on May 9, 1961, in Washington, DC. The speech is remembered for its
    key phrase: Minow told the roomful of television executives that if
    they watch their product in its entirety throughout the broadcast
    day, they “will observe a vast wasteland.” The speech really was
    about the duty television has to broadcast “in the public interest,”
    having been granted a large slice of the precious broadcasting
    spectrum. Do you believe that is still true today?  
        
     Reading this speech should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Professors Yates and Fargo provide a comprehensive
    look at the use of “indecent” language on television and the legal
    limitations placed on television networks. They describe how the
    success of pay-to-watch channels such as HBO in attracting viewers
    has caused television networks to “push the envelope” on using
    profanity. It also illustrates the difference between the freedom of
    speech most media enjoy with that of over-the-air broadcasters, who
    fall under the regulation of the FCC.

     Instructions: ESPN is without a doubt one of the most successful
    media ventures of the past 40 years. Today ESPN fields nine cable
    channels, including ESPN 3-D, and it cross promotes with its parent
    companies ABC and Disney. It also prints a magazine, programs a
    radio network, and operates a massive sports website, with web-only
    content. Media lawyer Philip R. Hochberg describes the rise of this
    entertainment giant.

     Instructions: ESPN’s own ombudsman, Le Anne Schreiber, discusses
    the “suffocating” cross promotion that goes on between ESPN’s
    channels, and with ABC − and the games ESPN ignores that are carried
    by other networks. Can you rely on ESPN as a factual source for

     Instructions: This reading and the one from the previous subunit
    discuss the ethics of ESPN as a factual source for sports while

     Instructions: Legend has it that actors who play doctors on
    television often get letters asking for medical advice. A more
    serious question is how what we watch on television affects our
    expectations in real-life arenas, such as the criminal courts. In
    the video from CBS News, prosecutors complain that jurors now expect
    high-tech forensic tests and quick action or they won’t convict
    someone who is obviously guilty.

     Instructions: Former National Public Radio correspondent John
    Hockenberry describes his days reporting for *Dateline NBC*, a
    magazine-format television news program modeled on CBS’ *60
    Minutes*. Both shows qualify as “infotainment,” news presented in a
    way to entertain and attract audiences. This view, Hockenberry
    contends, is at odds with news as a journalistic pursuit. Read all
    seven pages of his story for many illuminating anecdotes about
    television, technology and corporate culture.

     Instructions: FOX News was formed in 1996 by News Corp. tycoon
    Rupert Murdoch as a “fair and balanced” alternative to what he saw
    as the liberal mainstream media. He hired former political operative
    Roger Ailes to run the network, and Ailes led it to a position of
    high ratings and high profitability. FOX News represented a new kind
    of television channel; FAIR’s Seth Ackerman makes the case that
    Ailes wanted to bring right-wing talk radio to the television
    screen.

     Instructions: When we store television shows on a digital video
    recorder, we also capture the commercials. But those commercials
    might be out of date by the time you watch the show. As you read
    this article, think back to our unit on advertising and on the
    innovative ways advertisers are creating and distributing ads. You
    also might recall John Hockenberry’s description of a television
    executive’s fascination with TiVo, missing the point that it was a
    threat to his business (see subunit 8.2.6).
