**Unit 1: Mass Media as a Cultural Industry** <span id="1"></span> 
*We can think of mass communication as an activity, something people do
to get messages across to other people. That’s true if we consider only
the simplest definitions of mass communication and mass media. But the
messages produced by media organizations become part of our culture. In
many instances, they are efforts to change our culture, or even create
new cultures of community or of the mind. In this unit, we will explore
the history and development of media and culture, and we will examine
how the two are intertwined in our lives. We also will look at a
framework for analyzing media messages using the concepts of media
literacy. *

    culture allows organizations to bypass the gatekeeping function of
    mass media.
